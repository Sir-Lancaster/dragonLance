        <h3>Rules for your Characters</h3>
        <p>
            Firstly, make sure you join the campaign using this link: 
            <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/62420333754039395">Dragonlance Campaign</a>
             and then click create a character. 
        </p>
        <P>
            This campaign is made for the 2014 version of Dungeons and Dragons. So when you create your character,
            make sure you are selecting things that fit that version of the game.
        </P>
        <h3>D&D Beyond Creator Rules</h3>
        <p>
            When in the character builder the bar at the top has 6 tabs. On the home tab, 
            make sure the following are selected:
            <ul>
                <li>Expanded Rules (No Expanded rules have been remastered so they are all 2014 format.)</li>
                <li>2014 Core Rules</li>
                <li>Legacy</li>
                <li>Partnered Content: expand the list and unselect Free League</li>
                <li>Enable Dice Rolling</li>
                <li>Optional Class Features</li>
                <li>Advancement Type: Milestone</li>
                <li>Hit Point Type: Manual</li>
                <li>Use Prerequisites: Feats, and Multi-class</li>
                <li>Show Level Scaled Spells</li>
                <li>Use Encumbrance</li>
                <li><b>DO NOT</b> ignore coin weight</li>
                <li>Privacy: Campaign Only (unless you really want it public.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the class page, any class is allowed, but make sure you are selecting the 2014 version of the class if it is from the core rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be first level for now. If you are a spell casterm when you select spells use the legacy one if available,
            not all spells have a legacy version, so if it doesn't have one, don't worry about it. Or if you see one that has
            a feature you really want, ask if you can use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the background, any background is allowed, but make sure you are selecting the 2014 version of the background if it is from the core rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Races are allowed, but once again, make sure it's the 2014 version. I do want to know what race you choose
            as it can give you access to proprietery information. Also if you choose to be a Dragonborn, npc will be racist, you've been warned.
        </p>
        <p>
            For your abilities, choose the Manual/Rolled option. If you don't know how to roll for stats, ask me and I will help you.
            Being perfectly honest I won't mind if you cheat and just enter some of the stats you want. Like if you're a wizard
            and you want a high intelligence, I won't mind if you just enter an 18 for that stat. Just don't go overboard
            and make all your stats 18. I also do want your character to have some weaknesses, so make one of your stats less
            than 10. you get to choose the stat.
        </p>
        <p>
            For equipment, you can do either Equipment or Gold. Either way, I also want you to add 3 minor healing potions.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all that is done, go to your character sheet and navigate to the Features and traits tab, scroll down to 
            feats, and add a feat for which you meet the Prerequisites. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After your characters are complete I am going to go into your character sheets and add some information
            in the notes section. 
        </p>
