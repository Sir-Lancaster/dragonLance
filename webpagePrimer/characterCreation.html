        <h2>Rules for your Characters</h2>
        <P>
            This campaign is made for the 2014 version of Dungeons and Dragons. So when you create your character,
            make sure you are selecting things that fit that version of the game.
        </P>
        <h3>D&D Beyond Creator Rules</h3>
        <p>
            When in the character builder the bar at the top has 6 tabs. On the home tab, 
            make sure the following are selected:
            <ul>
                <li>Expanded Rules (No Expanded rules have been remastered so they are all 2014 format.)</li>
                <li>2014 Core Rules</li>
                <li>Legacy</li>
                <li>Partnered Content: expand the list and unselect Free League</li>
                <li>Enable Dice Rolling</li>
                <li>Optional Class Features</li>
                <li>Advancement Type: Milestone</li>
                <li>Hit Point Type: Manual</li>
                <li>Use Prerequisites: Feats, and Multi-class</li>
                <li>Show Level Scaled Spells</li>
                <li>Use Encumbrance</li>
                <li><b>DO NOT</b> ignore coin weight</li>
                <li>Privacy: Campaign Only (unless you really want it public.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the class page, any class is allowed, but make sure you are selecting the 2014 version of the class if it is from the core rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will be first level for now. If you are a spell casterm when you select spells use the legacy one if available,
            not all spells have a legacy version, so if it doesn't have one, don't worry about it. Or if you see one that has
            a feature you really want, ask if you can use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the background, any background is allowed, but make sure you are selecting the 2014 version of the background if it is from the core rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            All Races are allowed, but once again, make sure it's the 2014 version. I do want to know what race you choose
            as it can give you access to proprietery information. Also if you choose to be a Dragonborn, npc will be racist, you've been warned.
        </p>
        <p>
            For your abilities, choose the Manual/Rolled option. If you don't know how to roll for stats, ask me and I will help you.
            Being perfectly honest I won't mind if you cheat and just enter some of the stats you want. Like if you're a wizard
            and you want a high intelligence, I won't mind if you just enter an 18 for that stat. Just don't go overboard
            and make all your stats 18. I also do want your character to have some weaknesses, so make one of your stats less
            than 10. you get to choose the stat.
        </p>
        <p>
            For equipment, you can do either Equipment or Gold. Either way, I also want you to add 3 minor healing potions.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all that is done, go to your character sheet and navigate to the Features and traits tab, scroll down to 
            feats, and add a feat for which you meet the Prerequisites. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After your characters are complete I am going to go into your character sheets and add some information
            in the notes section. If you play a class that has divine magic, Please choose a god from the divinities page.
        </p>
        <h2>New Backgrounds and Language Replacements</h2>

        <p>
            The continent of Ansalon has organizations such as the Knigts of Solamnia, or the Mages of High Sorcery. Your 
            character can be a member of one of these organizations if you would like and so I have included information for them
            below.
        </p>
        <h3>Knights of Solamnia</h3>
        <div class="image-text-wrap">
            <img src="images/KnightOrders.png" class = "float-image">
            <p>
                Many celebrated heroes have risen from the Knights of Solamnia, the most storied knighthood on Ansalon. The knighthood 
                began over a thousand years ago, during the reign of the Ergothian Empire in western Ansalon. Vinas Solamnus, head of 
                the Ergothian imperial guard, was sent to eastern Ergoth to put down a massive rebellion. However, Solamnus learned of 
                the rebels’ grievances and, won over to their cause, he and the rebels marched on the Ergothian capital of Daltigoth. 
                The capital fell, and Vinas Solamnus was crowned king of a new independent nation on the eastern plains, called Solamnia 
                in his honor.
            </p>
            <p>
                King Solamnus sought above all to rule this new society justly. On the Isle of Sancrist, at a black granite stone in a 
                secluded glade, he prayed to the gods for guidance. Three of the gods of good appeared to him: Paladine, god of justice 
                and order; Kiri-Jolith, god of just warfare; and Habbakuk, god of nature, loyalty, and the elements. The three gods 
                inspired three orders of knights that would guard the realm together as the Knights of Solamnia.
            </p>

            <h4>Tarnished Pride</h4>
            <p>
                Before the Cataclysm, Solamnia was a beacon of peace and prosperity. The knights established great cities and castles 
                across the Plains of Solamnia, including Solanthus, Castle Brightblade, and Dargaard Keep. They ruled in accordance with 
                the ideals of Vinas Solamnus, and they forged an alliance with Istar that spread those ideals across the world. The people 
                of Solamnia attributed their prosperity to the wise and just rulership of the knights.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the wake of the Cataclysm, faith in the knighthood soured to suspicion. Rumors spread that the knighthood had possessed 
                the power to avert the Cataclysm and either failed to or chose not to—perhaps to dispense with Istar and solidify the knights’ 
                power.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most knights still tried to defend the realm as their duty demanded, but they found themselves beset on all sides, dying to 
                protect people who rejected and persecuted them. Most fled to Sancrist Isle in the west or retreated to the protection of their 
                strongholds and keeps, while others disguised themselves to continue their work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their power waning, the knights today are locked in a bitter internal feud: Is it better to maintain their strict codes even 
                in the face of obsolescence, secure in the knowledge they were true to themselves? Or should they embrace a changing world and 
                fight to defend it, even if the knights must change with it?
            </p>

            <h4>The Oath and the Measure</h4>
            <p>
                Their power waning, the knights today are locked in a bitter internal feud: Is it better to maintain their strict codes even in the 
                face of obsolescence, secure in the knowledge they were true to themselves? Or should they embrace a changing world and fight to defend 
                it, even if the knights must change with it?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The Oath.</b> The Oath of the Knights of Solamnia has been the same since Vinas Solamnus founded the knighthood: “Est Sularus oth Mithas,” 
                or “My Honor Is My Life.” This principle—to sacrifice all for the sake of honor—guides the actions of every knight, at least in theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The Measure.</b> In contrast to the Oath, the Measure is a staggeringly complicated, excruciatingly specific guide to knightly life. 
                Originally put forth by Vinas Solamnus as an organizational scheme and code of conduct for the knightly orders, the Measure grew over the 
                years to encompass thirty-seven volumes, covering everything from courtly etiquette to the proper saddling of mounts. According to the 
                Measure, the knights no longer have sufficient numbers to elect a new Grand Master, the highest office in the knighthood, leaving them 
                without an authority who could overrule or update the Measure. Despite this, a growing minority of knights push for a reform of the Measure, 
                believing that it’s unwieldy and outdated and that it no longer serves the ideals laid down by their founder.
            </p>

            <h4>Knightly Orders</h4>
            <p>
                Each Solamnic knight belongs to one of three orders. Each order, led by a High Knight elected from among its number, has its own hierarchy and 
                rules for admission. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Knights of the Crown.</b> Most knights begin their journey as squires in the Knights of the Crown, who honor the god Habbakuk as their 
                patron. The order emphasizes ideals of loyalty and obedience that serve as a bedrock whether a knight chooses to remain within the order or 
                move beyond it. Knights of the Crown are expected to aid any knight who requires assistance and any kingdom on the List of Loyalty, the 
                official roll of the Knights’ allies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Knights of the Sword.</b> Dedicated to heroic honor, courage, and reverence for the true gods, this order upholds the virtues of 
                Kiri-Jolith, the god of just war. Members dedicate themselves to courageous sacrifice, pledging to defend the defenseless without regard for 
                the knights’ personal suffering. Knights who join this order often undertake a heroic quest to prove their worth.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Knights of the Rose.</b> Guided by the god Paladine, the Knights of the Rose exemplify honor tempered by wisdom and justice. Before joining 
                their ranks, most knights rise within the Knights of the Sword after serving with the Knights of the Crown. Those who prove both their loyalty 
                and courage are fit to join this order, which upholds the knighthood’s highest ideals.
