        <h1>Gods of Krynn</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the world, 
            and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of 
            faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles occur across the 
            world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the 
            old ways and employ mysterious magic. Long-lived peoples 
            remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in 
            nature and the constellations above. Ancient, forgotten 
            sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine
            whispers reach those with the minds and hearts to listen. 
            The gods haven’t wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, 
            mortals turn to them once more—sometimes after a remarkable 
            encounter with a messenger of the gods.

        <h2>Gods of Good</h2>
        <hr class="subsections">
        <p>
            The gods of good provide healing and comfort to the mortals of Krynn. Although 
            they oppose the evil gods’ attempts to rule the world, their goal isn’t the 
            eradication of evil or its gods. Rather, their highest pursuit is preserving 
            mortal choice, despite the sorrowful knowledge that mortals sometimes choose 
            ruinous paths.

                <img src="images/Paladine.png" alt="Paladine" width="90%" height="90%">
            </div> <br> 
            Paladine is known as the Father of Good, the Master of Law, the Platinum Dragon, 
            and—on other worlds of the multiverse—Bahamut. He leads the gods of good and 
            watches over the world with an eye toward order, justice, and mercy. He teaches 
            that wise and just laws are the basis of a functioning society, and his clerics 
            often aid in crafting and upholding such laws. Paladine sometimes appears on 
            Krynn in the guise of Fizban, a befuddled old human mage in faded robes.

                </div> <br>
                Called the Bard King, Branchala is the god of music, poetry, and the inner beauty 
                of all living things. Many elves and kender worship him above all other gods. Both 
                groups revere him as a champion of life and laughter, bringing solace and joy to 
                those who listen.

                Habbakuk, known as the Fisher King, oversees animal life, the sea, and the balance 
                of nature. Many sailors, farmers, and hunters revere him. His holy sites are often 
                marked with the image of a blue bird or a phoenix wreathed in blue flames.

                </div> <br>
                Kiri-Jolith is the god of righteous war. He blesses all who fight in the name of good 
                and scorns those who delight in slaughter and lust for battle. He is particularly 
                revered by the Knights of the Sword, an order of the Knights of Solamnia that seeks 
                to root out evil wherever it dwells.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Majere</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                Austere and aloof, Majere is the god of meditation and discipline. Monks, 
                his most devoted followers, honor him by leading lives of quiet contemplation 
                in remote monasteries. Many orphans are raised in the monasteries of Majere; 
                some become monks themselves, while those who leave the monastic life often 
                take the surname Majere out of respect.
            </p>

                <h3>Mishakal</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                God of compassion, healing, and love, Mishakal is widely worshiped by healers 
                and community guardians. Throughout history, she has reached out to chosen 
                heroes to soothe others’ suffering. Her faithful offer healing and solace to all—even enemies.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Solinari</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                Solinari, the god of good magic, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order 
                of the White Robes and other benevolent mages. His power manifests through the 
                white moon of Krynn, the brightest of its three moons. Along with his cousins 
                Lunitari and Nuitari, he watches Krynn from the heavens and encourages magic that 
                aids, heals, and protects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Gods of Neutrality</h2>
        <hr class="subsections">
        The neutral gods of Krynn vary widely in their motivations and methods. Some are passive and distant, 
        dedicated to recording the actions of mortals or upholding the balance between societies and nature. 
        Others take a more active hand, injecting elements of chaos and innovation into mortal life. Unlike the 
        gods of good and evil, the neutral gods have little interest in the struggle over mortal destinies.
        <div class="godDescription">
            <p>
                <h3>Gilean</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                The god of knowledge and nominal leader of the neutral gods, Gilean embodies 
                the ideal of neutrality. He stands back and observes, recording all that unfolds. 
                Gilean is keeper of the Tobril, a book said to contain all the knowledge of the 
                gods, though portions are sealed to all but Gilean. Some people believe the scribe 
                Astinus of Palanthas to be Gilean in human form.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Chislev</h3> <div class="Symbols"> 
                    <img src="images/Chislev.png" alt="Chislev" width="90%" height="90%">
                </div> <br>
                Chislev is the god of nature on its own terms, governing the rhythms of life that unfold heedless of 
                mortal action. Though enigmatic and shy, they are fiercely protective of their domain, regarding all 
                plants and animals as their children. Chislev’s followers are often hermits, druids, and others who 
                revere nature without asking anything in return.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Lunitari</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                Lunitari, the god of neutral magic and illusions, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the 
                Red Robes and other neutral mages. With her cousins Solinari and Nuitari, she watches over the people of 
                Krynn from the heavens, conveying her power through the red moon that shares her name. She appears as a 
                trickster figure in mythology, using her mastery of illusions to fool gods and heroes alike.
            </p>

            <p>

                </div> <br>
                Reorx, the god of craft, is revered by dwarves, gnomes, and kender. He is the patron of smiths, 
                inventors, and artisans, and his followers believe that the act of creation is a form of worship. 
                Reorx is known for his quick temper and his love of a good joke, and he is said to have created 
                the world from the body of a slain dragon.

                </div> <br>
                Shinare is the god of wealth, industry, and commerce. Though many of her followers are merchants, 
                her influence spans legitimate and underhanded commerce alike, and she receives occasional worship 
                from thieves. Despite this, most consider her a god of fair dealing; supplicants pray she favors 
                them as they bargain.

                Passionate and impulsive, Sirrion is the god of alchemy, transformation, serendipitous creation, 
                and flames. He embodies momentary excitement, flaring quickly into fiery passion and smoldering 
                long afterward. Sirrion’s followers embrace extremes of emotion as forms of divine expression.
            </p>

            <p>

                </div> <br>
                Where Gilean embodies knowledge, Zivilyn exemplifies the calm wisdom necessary to wield knowledge 
                in the world. He’s said to exist in all times and places, possessing the collected wisdom of every 
                plane of existence. Zivilyn often attracts the worship of eccentrics, philosophers, and sages.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Gods of Evil</h2>
        <hr class="subsections"> 
        <p>
            The evil gods of Krynn embody power, vengeance, and other ideals that elevate self above community. 
            They wish to rule the mortal world, believing only they are worthy of such dominion. They rely on 
            temptation and subjugation to secure the service of lesser creatures. In every age, some mortals are 
            willing to sell their souls for power, and the gods of evil are eager to oblige.
        </p>
        <div class="godDescription">
            <p>
                <h3>Takhisis</h3> <div class="Symbols">

                </div> <br>
                Takhisis, leader of Krynn’s evil gods, is known as the Dragon Queen, the Queen of Darkness, or other such titles. 
                She is the god of power, pride, and control, as well as the queen of chromatic dragons. She tempts mortals to her 
                service with offers of dominance over others. Takhisis is the most feared of the gods of Krynn, and her followers
                sevrve with fanatic devotion. Unquestioning loyalty is rewarded with power and influence, while failure is met with
                swift and terrible punishment.

                Chemosh is the god of undeath and false redemption, tempting his followers with the promise of immortality. 
                Those who heed him find that while they may live forever, their bodies still decay and putrefy. Followers of 
                Chemosh embrace his baleful reputation, dressing in white skull masks and black robes.

                Hiddukel is the god of greed and treachery. He holds domain over all ill-gotten wealth in the world, and criminals 
                and unscrupulous traders worship him in secret (even if it is in jest and mockery). While Hiddukel gladly accepts their worship, his true goal is the 
                acquisition not of riches, but of souls.

                Solitary and secretive, Morgion is the god of disease and decay. He doesn’t consult or act in accord with the other 
                gods, preferring to brood in his otherworldly fortress, the Bronze Tower, and pursue his own schemes. His worshipers 
                follow his example, meeting in the dark and maintaining secrecy in all things.

                    Nuitari, the god of evil magic and darkness, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the Black Robes and 
                    other wicked mages. He encourages selfish and destructive magic. His power flows through the black moon that shares 
                    his name, which is visible only due to the stars it blocks in the sky.

                Sargonnas is the unpredictable god of flame, vengeance, and wrath. Though he’s a consort to Takhisis, he schemes against 
                her as often as he fights on her behalf. He is worshiped by those who seek retribution. His true form is that of a monstrous 
                minotaur, and many minotaurs revere him under the name Sargas.

                some make offerings to Zeboim to allay her wrath.
